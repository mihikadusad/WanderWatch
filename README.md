# WanderWatch

## Project Description
According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, a child goes missing every 40 seconds in the United States. More than 800,000 children are reported missing each year. To help aid the search for missing children, WanderWatch is a web application designed to update the spatial probability distributions of the possible location of a child based on live users in the vicinity. When a user loses their child, they can submit a segment of a road and the time interval that they lost the child. The spatial probabilities of the possible location of the child will update on the map interface using the Bayesian algorithm.

## Tools Used
* Frontend: HTML, CSS
* Backend: Javascript, Google Maps API, ArcGIS

Note: The Google Maps API membership has expired, so users may no longer launch WanderWatch directly from their PC. We ask that viewers watch the demo video instead to better understand how the software works.
